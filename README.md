Note: Make sure you device has a stable internet connectivity before running this project

I've created three users and three superusers.
Every pair of user belongs to each group.
Once your registration credential does match a specific group, you wont be able to see it's content.
You have a choice to choose what group you want to belong upon registration.
Only superusers have the permission to edit/delete a group's content.

For ease of access, these are the users and superusers created in the database already.
Note: use only either of the superuser or user account. Password is the same for each case

username (superuser/user): group1/group1user
password: 1430Gd@117

username (superuser/user): group2/group2user
password: 1430Gd@117

username (superuser/user): group3/group3user
password: 1430Gd@117

Note: You can create your own login credential for prototyping.

Thank You!.
